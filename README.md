<br>

<p>Players have to "hit" the changing pictures by getting a Toad face each time but "jumping" at the corresponding time. 
Each time the players gets a Toad face, they will get 1 point, and the spinning block gets a little faster.</p>
<br>
<p>If a player hits something other than a Toad face, the player gets stunned for 2 seconds. 
The first player who gets five Toad faces wins (5 points).</p>

<br>
You can play two ways: 1 vs 2 or 4 player.
